**.Summary of Password Attacks**

- ****Brute Force****: Tries all combinations; long & complex passwords help.
- ***Dictionary Attack****: Uses known words; avoid common words.
- ***Credential Stuffing****: Reuses leaked credentials; avoid reusing passwords.

**.Best Practices**

- Use at least 12–16 characters
- Mix upper, lower, numbers, and symbols
- Avoid predictable patterns
- Use passphrases or password managers
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)//passwordmeter.com/)
